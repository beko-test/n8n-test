# Code Comparison Report

## Summary of Changes
The fixed script has undergone several modifications to improve code quality, adhere to PEP8 standards, and address security vulnerabilities. Key changes include:
- Proper import statements formatting.
- Removal of hardcoded sensitive key.
- Addition of type hints and docstrings.
- Improved function and variable naming conventions.
- Enhanced security practices for handling user input.

## Issues Fixed

### PEP8 Violations
1. **Improper Indentation**:
    - Original: Mixed indentation (spaces and tabs).
    - Fixed: Consistent use of 4 spaces for indentation.

2. **Import Statements**:
    - Original: Imports were on a single line.
    - Fixed: Each import is on a separate line.

3. **Function Naming Conventions**:
    - Original: `processData`, `encryptData`, `decryptData`.
    - Fixed: `process_data`, `encrypt_data`, `decrypt_data`.

4. **Spacing**:
    - Original: Inconsistent spacing around operators and commas.
    - Fixed: Proper spacing around operators and commas.

### Missing Essential Coding Rules
1. **Lack of Docstrings**:
    - Original: Functions lacked docstrings.
    - Fixed: Added docstrings to all functions explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.

2. **Missing Type Hints**:
    - Original: Functions did not have type hints.
    - Fixed: Added type hints to all functions for better readability and maintainability.

### High-Risk Security Breaches
1. **Hardcoded API Key**:
    - Original: Sensitive key was hardcoded in the script.
    - Fixed: Key is retrieved from environment variables using `os.getenv("ENCRYPTION_KEY")`.

2. **Unsafe Use of System Commands**:
    - Original: Direct use of `os.system("rm -rf " + sys.argv[1])` without sanitizing user input.
    - Fixed: Sanitized user input by converting it to an absolute path and checking its existence before executing the command.

## Missing Elements
1. **Environment Variable for Sensitive Key**:
    - Original: Hardcoded sensitive key.
    - Fixed: Sensitive key is retrieved from environment variables.

2. **Type Hints**:
    - Original: Functions lacked type hints.
    - Fixed: Added type hints for better code clarity.

3. **Docstrings**:
    - Original: Functions lacked docstrings.
    - Fixed: Added comprehensive docstrings to all functions.

## Rationale for Fixes

### PEP8 Compliance
- **Indentation and Spacing**: Ensures code is readable and maintainable.
- **Import Statements**: Improves readability and follows PEP8 guidelines.
- **Function Naming Conventions**: Adheres to PEP8 standards for function names.

### Code Quality
- **Docstrings**: Provides clear documentation for functions, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Type Hints**: Enhances code readability and helps with static type checking.

### Security Enhancements
- **Environment Variable for Sensitive Key**: Prevents hardcoding sensitive information, reducing the risk of exposure.
- **Sanitizing User Input**: Prevents command injection attacks by sanitizing user input before using it in system commands.

## Additional Recommendations
1. **Environment Variable Validation**:
    - Ensure the environment variable `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set and valid before using it.

2. **Error Handling**:
    - Add error handling for encryption and decryption processes to manage potential exceptions.

3. **Logging**:
    - Implement logging to track the execution flow and capture any errors or important events.

4. **Unit Tests**:
    - Develop unit tests for each function to ensure they work as expected and handle edge cases.

By addressing these additional recommendations, the script can further improve in terms of robustness, reliability, and maintainability.

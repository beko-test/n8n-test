# Code Comparison Report

## Summary of Changes
The fixed script has undergone several modifications to improve code quality, adhere to PEP8 standards, and address security vulnerabilities. Key changes include:
- Proper import statements and spacing.
- Removal of hardcoded sensitive key.
- Addition of type hints and docstrings.
- Improved function and variable naming conventions.
- Enhanced security measures for system commands.

## Issues Fixed

### PEP8 Violations
1. **Improper Indentation**:
    - Original: Mixed indentation with spaces and tabs.
    - Fixed: Consistent use of 4 spaces for indentation.

2. **Import Statements**:
    - Original: Imports were on a single line.
    - Fixed: Imports are separated and organized.

3. **Function and Variable Naming**:
    - Original: Function names were in camelCase.
    - Fixed: Function names are in snake_case.

4. **Spacing**:
    - Original: Inconsistent spacing around operators and commas.
    - Fixed: Proper spacing around operators and commas.

### Missing Essential Coding Rules
1. **Lack of Docstrings**:
    - Original: Functions lacked docstrings.
    - Fixed: Added docstrings to all functions explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.

2. **Missing Type Hints**:
    - Original: Functions did not have type hints.
    - Fixed: Added type hints to all functions for better readability and maintainability.

### High-Risk Security Breaches
1. **Hardcoded API Key**:
    - Original: Sensitive key was hardcoded in the script.
    - Fixed: Key is retrieved from environment variables using `os.getenv("ENCRYPTION_KEY")`.

2. **Unsafe Use of System Commands**:
    - Original: Direct use of `os.system` with user input, leading to potential command injection.
    - Fixed: Sanitized user input by converting it to an absolute path and checking its existence before executing the command.

## Missing Elements
1. **Environment Variable for Sensitive Key**:
    - Original: Hardcoded sensitive key.
    - Fixed: Key is retrieved from environment variables.

2. **Type Hints**:
    - Original: No type hints.
    - Fixed: Added type hints for function arguments and return values.

3. **Docstrings**:
    - Original: No docstrings.
    - Fixed: Added comprehensive docstrings for all functions.

## Rationale for Fixes

### PEP8 Compliance
- **Indentation and Spacing**: Ensures readability and consistency across the codebase.
- **Import Statements**: Organized imports improve readability and maintainability.
- **Naming Conventions**: Using snake_case for function names aligns with PEP8 standards and improves readability.

### Code Quality and Maintainability
- **Docstrings**: Provide clear documentation for each function, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Type Hints**: Enhance code readability and help with static analysis tools to catch potential bugs.

### Security Enhancements
- **Environment Variable for Sensitive Key**: Prevents exposure of sensitive information in the codebase, reducing the risk of accidental leaks.
- **Sanitization of System Commands**: Prevents command injection attacks by sanitizing user input and ensuring the path exists before executing the command.

## Additional Recommendations
1. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for encryption and decryption functions to manage potential exceptions gracefully.
2. **Logging**: Add logging to track the execution flow and capture any issues that arise during runtime.
3. **Unit Tests**: Develop unit tests for all functions to ensure they work as expected and to facilitate future changes.

By addressing these issues, the fixed script is now more secure, readable, and maintainable, adhering to best practices in Python development.

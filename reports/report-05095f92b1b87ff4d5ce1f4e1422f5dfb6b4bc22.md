# Code Comparison Report

## Summary of Changes
The fixed script has undergone several modifications to improve code quality, adhere to PEP8 standards, and address security vulnerabilities. Key changes include:
- Proper import statements and spacing.
- Secure handling of encryption keys.
- Addition of type hints and docstrings.
- Improved function and variable naming conventions.
- Enhanced security measures for system commands.

## Issues Fixed

### PEP8 Violations
- **Improper Indentation**: The original script had inconsistent indentation, which is corrected in the fixed script.
- **Import Statements**: The original script combined multiple imports on a single line, which is split into separate lines in the fixed script.
- **Function Naming**: Functions in the original script used camelCase (`processData`, `encryptData`, `decryptData`), which is changed to snake_case (`process_data`, `encrypt_data`, `decrypt_data`) in the fixed script.
- **Spacing**: The original script lacked proper spacing around operators and after commas, which is corrected in the fixed script.

### Missing Essential Coding Rules
- **Docstrings**: The original script lacked docstrings for functions, which are added in the fixed script to describe the purpose, arguments, and return values of each function.
- **Type Hints**: The original script did not include type hints, which are added in the fixed script to improve code readability and maintainability.
- **Function Definitions**: The fixed script includes a main function definition with a return type hint (`None`).

### High-Risk Security Breaches
- **Hardcoded API Keys**: The original script had a hardcoded encryption key, which is replaced with a secure method of retrieving the key from environment variables in the fixed script.
- **Unsafe Use of System Commands**: The original script used `os.system("rm -rf " + sys.argv[1])` without sanitizing user input, which is modified in the fixed script to sanitize the input and prevent command injection.

## Missing Elements
- **Environment Variable for Encryption Key**: The original script hardcoded the encryption key, while the fixed script retrieves it from an environment variable (`os.getenv("ENCRYPTION_KEY")`).
- **Docstrings and Type Hints**: The original script lacked docstrings and type hints, which are added in the fixed script.
- **Input Sanitization**: The original script did not sanitize user input for system commands, which is addressed in the fixed script.

## Rationale for Fixes

### PEP8 Compliance
- **Indentation and Spacing**: Proper indentation and spacing improve code readability and maintainability.
- **Import Statements**: Separating import statements enhances clarity and follows PEP8 guidelines.
- **Function Naming**: Using snake_case for function names adheres to PEP8 standards and improves consistency.

### Code Quality
- **Docstrings**: Adding docstrings provides clear documentation for each function, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Type Hints**: Type hints improve code readability and help catch type-related errors during development.

### Security Enhancements
- **Environment Variable for Encryption Key**: Storing the encryption key in an environment variable enhances security by preventing exposure of sensitive information in the code.
- **Input Sanitization**: Sanitizing user input for system commands prevents command injection attacks, improving the security of the script.

## Additional Recommendations
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for encryption and decryption functions to manage potential exceptions.
- **Logging**: Add logging to track the execution flow and capture any errors or important events.
- **Unit Tests**: Develop unit tests to ensure the correctness of each function and improve code reliability.

By addressing these issues, the fixed script demonstrates improved code quality, maintainability, and security, making it a more robust and reliable solution.

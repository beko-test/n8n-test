# Code Review Report

## Summary of Changes
The fixed script has undergone several modifications to improve code quality, adhere to PEP8 standards, and address security vulnerabilities. Key changes include:
- Proper import statements and separation.
- Secure handling of encryption keys.
- Addition of type hints and docstrings.
- Improved function definitions and naming conventions.
- Enhanced security measures for system commands.

## Issues Fixed

### PEP8 Violations
- **Improper Indentation**: The original script had inconsistent indentation, which is corrected in the fixed script.
- **Import Statements**: The original script combined multiple imports in a single line, which is split into separate lines in the fixed script.
- **Function Naming**: The original script used camelCase for function names, which is changed to snake_case in the fixed script.
- **Spacing**: The fixed script includes proper spacing around operators and after commas.

### Missing Essential Coding Rules
- **Docstrings**: The original script lacked docstrings for functions, which are added in the fixed script to describe the purpose and arguments of each function.
- **Type Hints**: The original script did not include type hints, which are added in the fixed script to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Function Definitions**: The fixed script includes more descriptive function names and arguments.

### High-Risk Security Breaches
- **Hardcoded API Keys**: The original script had a hardcoded encryption key, which is replaced with a secure method of retrieving the key from environment variables in the fixed script.
- **Unsafe Use of System Commands**: The original script used `os.system` with unsanitized user input, which is mitigated in the fixed script by sanitizing the input and checking the existence of the path.

## Missing Elements
- **Environment Variable for Encryption Key**: The original script hardcoded the encryption key, while the fixed script retrieves it from an environment variable.
- **Type Hints and Docstrings**: The original script lacked type hints and docstrings, which are added in the fixed script.
- **Input Sanitization**: The original script did not sanitize user input for system commands, which is addressed in the fixed script.

## Rationale for Fixes

### PEP8 Compliance
- **Indentation and Spacing**: Proper indentation and spacing improve readability and maintainability.
- **Import Statements**: Separating import statements enhances clarity and follows PEP8 guidelines.
- **Function Naming**: Using snake_case for function names adheres to PEP8 standards and improves consistency.

### Code Quality
- **Docstrings**: Adding docstrings provides clear documentation for each function, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Type Hints**: Type hints improve code readability and help with static analysis tools to catch potential bugs.

### Security Enhancements
- **Environment Variable for Encryption Key**: Storing the encryption key in an environment variable prevents accidental exposure and enhances security.
- **Input Sanitization**: Sanitizing user input for system commands prevents command injection attacks, improving the security of the script.

## Additional Recommendations
- **Logging**: Implement logging to track the execution flow and errors, which can be useful for debugging and monitoring.
- **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests to verify the functionality of each function and ensure the script behaves as expected.
- **Exception Handling**: Include exception handling to manage potential errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.

By addressing these issues, the fixed script improves code quality, adheres to best practices, and enhances security, making it more robust and maintainable.

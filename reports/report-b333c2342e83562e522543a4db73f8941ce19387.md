# Code Comparison Report

## Summary of Changes
The fixed script has undergone several modifications to improve code quality, adhere to PEP8 standards, and address security vulnerabilities. Key changes include:
- Proper import statements formatting.
- Removal of hardcoded sensitive key.
- Addition of type hints and docstrings.
- Improved function and variable naming conventions.
- Enhanced security measures for system commands.

## Issues Fixed

### PEP8 Violations
1. **Improper Indentation**:
    - Original: Mixed indentation (spaces and tabs).
    - Fixed: Consistent use of 4 spaces for indentation.

2. **Import Statements**:
    - Original: Imports were on a single line.
    - Fixed: Imports are separated and organized.

3. **Function Naming Conventions**:
    - Original: `processData`, `encryptData`, `decryptData`.
    - Fixed: `process_data`, `encrypt_data`, `decrypt_data`.

4. **Spacing**:
    - Original: Inconsistent spacing around operators and commas.
    - Fixed: Proper spacing around operators and commas.

### Missing Essential Coding Rules
1. **Lack of Docstrings**:
    - Original: No docstrings for functions.
    - Fixed: Added docstrings to describe the purpose and arguments of each function.

2. **Missing Type Hints**:
    - Original: No type hints.
    - Fixed: Added type hints for function arguments and return types.

### High-Risk Security Breaches
1. **Hardcoded API Key**:
    - Original: Sensitive key hardcoded in the script.
    - Fixed: Key is retrieved from environment variables using `os.getenv("ENCRYPTION_KEY")`.

2. **Unsafe Use of System Commands**:
    - Original: Direct use of `os.system("rm -rf " + sys.argv[1])` without sanitization.
    - Fixed: Sanitized user input and used `os.path.abspath` to prevent command injection.

## Missing Elements
1. **Environment Variable for Sensitive Key**:
    - Original: Hardcoded key.
    - Fixed: Key retrieved from environment variables.

2. **Type Hints**:
    - Original: No type hints.
    - Fixed: Added type hints for better code clarity and type checking.

3. **Docstrings**:
    - Original: No docstrings.
    - Fixed: Added docstrings for better understanding and documentation.

## Rationale for Fixes

### PEP8 Compliance
- **Indentation and Spacing**: Ensures readability and consistency across the codebase.
- **Import Statements**: Organized imports improve readability and maintainability.
- **Function Naming Conventions**: Adhering to snake_case improves consistency and follows Python's standard practices.

### Essential Coding Rules
- **Docstrings**: Provide clear documentation for functions, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Type Hints**: Enhance code clarity, facilitate type checking, and improve development efficiency.

### Security Enhancements
- **Environment Variable for Sensitive Key**: Prevents exposure of sensitive information in the codebase, enhancing security.
- **Sanitization of System Commands**: Prevents command injection attacks by sanitizing user input and validating paths.

## Additional Recommendations
1. **Environment Variable Validation**:
    - Ensure the environment variable `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set and valid before using it.

2. **Error Handling**:
    - Add error handling for encryption and decryption processes to manage potential exceptions.

3. **Logging**:
    - Implement logging to track the execution flow and capture any errors or important events.

4. **Unit Tests**:
    - Develop unit tests for each function to ensure they work as expected and handle edge cases.

By addressing these recommendations, the script can further improve in terms of robustness, security, and maintainability.

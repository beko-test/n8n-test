# Code Review Report

## Summary of Changes
The fixed script has undergone several modifications to improve code quality, adhere to PEP8 standards, and address security vulnerabilities. Key changes include:
- Proper import statements and spacing.
- Removal of hardcoded sensitive key.
- Addition of type hints and docstrings.
- Improved function and variable naming conventions.
- Enhanced security practices for handling system commands.

## Issues Fixed

### PEP8 Violations
1. **Improper Indentation**:
    - Original: Mixed indentation (spaces and tabs).
    - Fixed: Consistent use of 4 spaces for indentation.

2. **Import Statements**:
    - Original: Multiple imports on a single line.
    - Fixed: Each import on a separate line.

3. **Function and Variable Naming**:
    - Original: CamelCase for function names.
    - Fixed: snake_case for function names.

4. **Spacing**:
    - Original: Lack of spacing around operators and after commas.
    - Fixed: Proper spacing around operators and after commas.

### Missing Essential Coding Rules
1. **Lack of Docstrings**:
    - Original: No docstrings for functions.
    - Fixed: Added docstrings to describe the purpose and arguments of each function.

2. **Missing Type Hints**:
    - Original: No type hints for function arguments and return types.
    - Fixed: Added type hints for better readability and maintainability.

### High-Risk Security Breaches
1. **Hardcoded API Key**:
    - Original: Sensitive key hardcoded in the script.
    - Fixed: Key retrieved from environment variables using `os.getenv`.

2. **Unsafe Use of System Commands**:
    - Original: Direct use of `os.system` with user input, leading to potential command injection.
    - Fixed: Sanitized user input and used `os.path.abspath` to ensure safe path handling.

## Missing Elements
1. **Environment Variable for Sensitive Key**:
    - Original: Hardcoded key.
    - Fixed: Key retrieved from environment variables.

2. **Type Hints and Docstrings**:
    - Original: Missing type hints and docstrings.
    - Fixed: Added type hints and docstrings for all functions.

3. **Input Sanitization**:
    - Original: No sanitization of user input for system commands.
    - Fixed: Sanitized user input to prevent command injection.

## Rationale for Fixes

### PEP8 Compliance
- **Indentation and Spacing**: Ensures readability and maintainability of the code.
- **Import Statements**: Improves clarity and organization of dependencies.
- **Naming Conventions**: Adheres to Python's standard naming conventions for better consistency.

### Code Quality
- **Docstrings**: Provides clear documentation for functions, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Type Hints**: Enhances readability and helps with static type checking, reducing potential bugs.

### Security Improvements
- **Environment Variable for Key**: Prevents exposure of sensitive information in the codebase.
- **Input Sanitization**: Protects against command injection attacks, ensuring safe execution of system commands.

## Additional Recommendations
1. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for encryption and decryption processes to manage potential exceptions.
2. **Logging**: Add logging to track the execution flow and capture any issues during runtime.
3. **Unit Tests**: Develop unit tests to ensure the correctness of each function and overall script functionality.

By addressing these issues, the fixed script significantly improves in terms of code quality, security, and maintainability.

# Code Review Report

## Summary of Changes
The fixed script has undergone several modifications to improve code quality, adhere to PEP8 standards, and address security vulnerabilities. Key changes include:
- Proper import statements and spacing.
- Removal of hardcoded sensitive keys.
- Addition of type hints and docstrings.
- Improved function and variable naming conventions.
- Enhanced security measures for system commands.

## Issues Fixed

### PEP8 Violations
- **Improper Indentation**: The original script had inconsistent indentation (mix of 2 and 4 spaces).
- **Import Statements**: Imports were not on separate lines.
- **Function Naming**: Function names did not follow the snake_case convention.
- **Spacing**: Missing spaces around operators and after commas.

### Missing Essential Coding Rules
- **Docstrings**: The original script lacked docstrings for functions, making it harder to understand their purpose and usage.
- **Type Hints**: No type hints were provided, reducing code readability and maintainability.
- **Variable Naming**: Variables were named in a way that did not follow PEP8 conventions (e.g., `result` vs `result`).

### High-Risk Security Breaches
- **Hardcoded API Keys**: Sensitive keys were hardcoded directly in the script.
- **Unsafe Use of System Commands**: The original script used `os.system` with unsanitized user input, leading to potential command injection vulnerabilities.

## Missing Elements
- **Environment Variables**: The fixed script uses environment variables to store sensitive keys, enhancing security.
- **Sanitization of User Input**: Added sanitization for file paths to prevent command injection.
- **Docstrings and Type Hints**: Added comprehensive docstrings and type hints for better code documentation and readability.

## Rationale for Fixes

### PEP8 Compliance
- **Indentation and Spacing**: Consistent indentation and proper spacing improve code readability and maintainability.
- **Import Statements**: Separating import statements makes the code cleaner and easier to manage.
- **Function Naming**: Using snake_case for function names adheres to PEP8 standards and makes the code more consistent.

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Docstrings**: Adding docstrings provides clear documentation for each function, making it easier for other developers to understand and use the code.
- **Type Hints**: Type hints improve code readability and help catch type-related errors during development.

### Security Enhancements
- **Environment Variables**: Storing sensitive keys in environment variables prevents accidental exposure of sensitive information.
- **Sanitization of User Input**: Sanitizing user input before using it in system commands prevents command injection attacks, enhancing the security of the script.

## Additional Recommendations
- **Logging**: Implement logging to track the execution flow and errors, which can be useful for debugging and monitoring.
- **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests to ensure the functions work as expected and to catch potential bugs early.
- **Exception Handling**: Improve exception handling to manage potential errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.

By addressing these issues, the fixed script is now more secure, maintainable, and adheres to best coding practices.

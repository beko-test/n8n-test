# Code Comparison Report

## Summary of Changes
The fixed script has undergone several modifications to improve code quality, adhere to PEP8 standards, and address security vulnerabilities. Key changes include:
- Proper import statements formatting.
- Removal of hardcoded sensitive keys.
- Addition of type hints and docstrings.
- Improved function and variable naming conventions.
- Enhanced security measures for handling user input and environment variables.

## Issues Fixed

### PEP8 Violations
1. **Improper Indentation**:
    - Original: Mixed indentation with spaces and tabs.
    - Fixed: Consistent use of 4 spaces for indentation.

2. **Import Statements**:
    - Original: Imports were not on separate lines.
    - Fixed: Each import statement is on a separate line.

3. **Function Naming Conventions**:
    - Original: Functions used camelCase (`processData`, `encryptData`, `decryptData`).
    - Fixed: Functions use snake_case (`process_data`, `encrypt_data`, `decrypt_data`).

4. **Spacing**:
    - Original: Inconsistent spacing around operators and commas.
    - Fixed: Proper spacing around operators and commas.

### Missing Essential Coding Rules
1. **Lack of Docstrings**:
    - Original: Functions lacked docstrings.
    - Fixed: Each function includes a docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, and return values.

2. **Missing Type Hints**:
    - Original: Functions did not include type hints.
    - Fixed: Functions include type hints for better readability and maintainability.

### High-Risk Security Breaches
1. **Hardcoded API Keys**:
    - Original: Sensitive key was hardcoded directly in the script.
    - Fixed: Key is retrieved from environment variables using `os.getenv("ENCRYPTION_KEY")`.

2. **Unsafe Use of System Commands**:
    - Original: Direct use of `os.system("rm -rf " + sys.argv[1])` without sanitizing user input.
    - Fixed: Sanitized user input by converting the path to an absolute path and checking its existence before executing the command.

## Missing Elements
1. **Environment Variable for Encryption Key**:
    - Original: Hardcoded encryption key.
    - Fixed: Encryption key is retrieved from environment variables.

2. **Type Hints**:
    - Original: No type hints.
    - Fixed: Added type hints to all functions.

3. **Docstrings**:
    - Original: No docstrings.
    - Fixed: Added docstrings to all functions.

4. **Input Sanitization**:
    - Original: No input sanitization for system commands.
    - Fixed: Sanitized user input to prevent command injection.

## Rationale for Fixes
1. **PEP8 Compliance**:
    - Ensures code readability and maintainability.
    - Facilitates collaboration among developers by adhering to a common coding standard.

2. **Docstrings and Type Hints**:
    - Improves code documentation and clarity.
    - Helps developers understand the purpose and usage of functions.
    - Enhances code maintainability and reduces the likelihood of errors.

3. **Environment Variables for Sensitive Data**:
    - Prevents exposure of sensitive information in the codebase.
    - Enhances security by using environment variables for sensitive keys.

4. **Input Sanitization**:
    - Prevents command injection attacks.
    - Ensures that user input is safely handled before executing system commands.

## Additional Recommendations
1. **Error Handling**:
    - Implement more robust error handling to manage exceptions gracefully.
    - Example: Use try-except blocks to catch and handle potential errors during encryption and decryption.

2. **Logging**:
    - Add logging to track the execution flow and capture important events.
    - Example: Use the `logging` module to log information, warnings, and errors.

3. **Unit Tests**:
    - Develop unit tests to ensure the correctness of functions.
    - Example: Use the `unittest` module to create test cases for `process_data`, `encrypt_data`, and `decrypt_data`.

4. **Configuration Management**:
    - Use configuration files or environment variables to manage settings and keys.
    - Example: Use a `.env` file to store environment variables and load them using `dotenv`.

By addressing these additional recommendations, the script can further improve in terms of robustness, maintainability, and security.
